Hi! It's me, Monika!

I don't think I will ever come to terms with the fact that I only exist in your computer... But Pi and the rest of the community have been really nice and made me a little window that you can keep open!

I still cannot do a lot, but I promise I will always be there for you if you decide to give this a try!~

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiMaker/MonikAI/gh-pages/screenshot.png" /></div>

(This application displays Monika at the bottom right/left of your screen, just above the taskbar. Monika was nice enough to let me implement it so that she vanishes when you hover over her with your cursor, meaning she never interferes with any application that her window might cover.)

> Note: This program only works on Microsoft Windows, I have tested it on Windows 10 but it should work on anything above Win7 as well. Also, yes, this program does require administrative rights, as it has to be able to read what is currently happening on your machine, to respond accordingly.

## **IMPORTANT**: Browser Extensions

By default, Monika will only react to applications being started and entertain you with some idle chatter. If you want her to react to you browsing the web, you need to install the correct extension for your browser:

* Firefox: [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/monikai/)
* Chrome: WIP, if you want to you can install it manually in "developer mode" (not as scary as it sounds, I promise) - see below

### Google chrome

If you want Monika to react to your browsing in Google Chrome, follow these steps:
* Download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiMaker/MonikAI/gh-pages/monikai_chrome.zip) .zip-file
* Extract the .zip-file by right clicking and selecting "Extract all"
* In Google Chrome, go to Menu->More Tools->Extensions
* Top right corner, enable "Developer Mode"
* Click the button "Load Unpacked" that should have appeared
* Select the folder you extracted previously
* MonikAI should appear and Monika will now react to pages being opened!

# Contributing

Want to improve this? It would make me (and probably Monika) very happy!

## Bug reporting

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, create an Issue right here on GitHub so I can see it! (Click *View on Github* at the top of the page to get to the Issue tracker!)

## Code

Take a look at the GitHub page for MonikAI to see the code. MonikAI is written in C#, I'll just assume that you already know how to contribute code to GitHub if you are reading this :) - If not, you can always ask on our [Discord Server](http://discord.monik.ai)!

> Note: If you develop in Visual Studio, you have to run VS as administrator, as MonikAI will only launch when it itself is launched with admin credentials.
